  <h1>HackerRank Python Problem Solutions</h1>
  <p>This repository contains my solutions to various Python problems on HackerRank. Each problem is solved using Python programming language.</p>

  <h2>Getting Started</h2>
  <p>To run the solutions locally or test them on your machine, follow these steps:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Make sure you have Python installed on your machine. You can download it from the official Python website: <a href="https://www.python.org/downloads/">https://www.python.org/downloads/</a></li>
    <li>Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:<br>
      <code>git clone https://github.com/3bduu/Hackerank_Python_Problems.git</code></li>
    <li>Navigate to the cloned directory:<br>
      <code>cd Hackerank_Python_Problems</code></li>
    <li>Each problem has its own directory with the problem name. Open the directory for the specific problem you want to solve.</li>
    <li>Open the solution file (usually named <code>solution.py</code>) in a text editor or an IDE of your choice.</li>
    <li>Read the problem description and the instructions provided in the comments at the beginning of the solution file.</li>
    <li>Modify the code if needed or simply run it using Python from the command line:<br>
      <code>python solution.py</code></li>
  </ol>
  <p>Feel free to explore the problems, review the solutions, and use them as a reference for your own learning and practice.</p>
